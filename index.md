Hello! My name is Nicole Neece and I'm currently a Ph.D. Student in University of Central Florida's Texts and Technology program.

I have always been a devout fangirl, and my passions have bled into my research interests over time. During my master's program, I studied how fans were utilizng rape narratives, also known as non-con, in their fan fiction. This is something I would like to expand upon in my doctoral studies. Another interest area of mine is learning more about 'disturbing media'. What is it? Why do people seek it out? Is 'disturbing' a genre? I don't know, but I'd like to find out!

I have some of my background information and social media pages linked on this site. Please feel free to hit me up! :)
